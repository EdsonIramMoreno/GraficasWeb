This was my final project of a 7th semester subject called Web Graphics, it is a basic 3D game, where the main objective is to gather items without catching a bomb, it has two diferent difficulties and also has two game modes:

- **Classic**: Gather the most amount of items in a limited time to earn points, every bomb that you catch is a decrement of points.
- **Survival**: Gather the most amount of items in an unlimited time to earn points, if you catch a bomb is game over.

### Build Status

------------

It is a complete game in terms of gameplay and usability, but the "Records"
it's not available due to its API & Database not being hosted.

##Tech/Framework used

The disign was developed with HTML & CSS, most of the disign was created as image with the help of image editors and the functionality of the menus was done with JavaScript.

The gameplay was developed with Javascript and a JS library called [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/ "ThreeJS").
